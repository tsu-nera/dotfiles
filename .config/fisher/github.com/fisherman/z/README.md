# Z

**z** is a port of [z](http://github.com/rupa/z) for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

**z** tracks the directories you visit. With a combination of frequency and recency, it enables you to jump to the directory in mind.

A _pure-fish_ port means **z** is _fast_ and _fish-friendly_, with tab-completions and lazy-loading. Top that off with great customizability and a small amount of added functionality.

## Installation

We recommend using [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to install **z**.

### fish >=2.7.0

```
fisher add jethrokuan/z
```

### fish <2.7.0

Install the legacy z plugin:

```
fisher add z@pre27
```

### fish 2.2.0 :warning:

Z is not available for fish 2.2.0 or older. Please upgrade your shell.

## Usage

See [man/man1/z.md](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z/blob/master/man/man1/z.md) for details.
